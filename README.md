## This repository contains the code files and the dataset used for the implementation of process mining.

The implementation is purely based on the PMYPy library in python. The algorightms in this library is mostly based on the factory methods however, is an open source tool and is continually being developed and improvised.

The dataset used in this implementation is from a Dutch Financial Institute containing the Loan application events. The source of this dataset is : https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2012/12689204. Citation: DOI doi:10.4121/uuid:3926db30-f712-4394-aebc-75976070e91f

The purpose of the implementation is to demonstrate an 'Art of Possible' solution for implementing Process Mining in the organisation within its own organisation withput integrating to third party commercial tools and opportunity to build and remain competetive in the process mining market.
